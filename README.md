<h1>Simple Digital Library </h1>
My project is a simplified digital library where the user can enter the books they've read into their library, along with the date they started it and the date they finished it. The program will calculate how long it to read the book and put that into the library as well. 

I used the CSS grid position technique. 
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
